# buildroot
Buildroot for THEAD CPU ISA

## Introduction
Buildroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using cross-compilation.
In order to achieve this, Buildroot is able to generate a cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image and a bootloader for your target. Buildroot can be used for any combination of these options, independently (you can for example use an existing cross-compilation toolchain, and build only your root filesystem with Buildroot).

Thead buildroot is based on Buildroot and make some project-specific customizations.

## Get Started
    1. prepare a project work directory just like 'Project'
    2. cd Project
    3. git clone https://github.com/c-sky/buildroot.git or git@github.com:c-sky/buildroot.git

## Directory Structure
When customizing Buildroot, one or more project-specific files need to be stored somewhere. Thead buildroot follows recommendation from the Buildroot developers, as described in this section.
